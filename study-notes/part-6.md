# TOGAF 101 

## Part 6 - Architecture Capability Framework
- Provides a set of reference materials for how to establish such an architecture function
- The structure of Architecture Capability Framework includes
   - Architecture Board
   - Architecture Compliance
   - Architecture Contracts
   - Architecture Governance
   - Architecture Maturity Models
   - Architecture Skills Framework

####  Use of ADM to Establish an Architecture Capability
- The establishment of an Architecture Capability can be supported by the TOGAF ADM
- **Estabilished in ADM Preliminary Phase and Operated in Phase G-H**
- ADM is an ideal method to be used to architect and govern the implementation of architecture capability 

|   Domain   |  Architecture Capability    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Business Architecture  | Architecture Governance, architecture processes, architecture organizational structure, architecture information requirements, architecture products, etc. | 
| Data Architecture | Structure of the organization's Enterprise Continuum and Architecture Repository |
| Application Architecture | Specifying the functionality and/or applications services required to enable the architecture practice |
| Technology Architecture | Architecture practice's infrastructure requirements and deployment in support of the architecture applications and Enterprise Continuum |

#### Architecture Capability
- It is an evaluation of your ability to define Enterprise Architecture
- In order to successfully operate an architecture function within an enterprise, it is necessary to put in place appropriate ***organization structures, processes, roles, responsibilities, and skills*** to realize the Architecture Capability
- Ability to estabilish the **Architecture Contract** is also the part of the Architecture Capability

#### Architecture Governance
- The practice and orientation by which Enterprise Architectures and other architectures are managed and controlled
- Characteristics or Principles of Good Governance 
   - ***DTIARF***- ***Discipline*** (D), ***Transparency*** (T), ***Independence*** (I), ***Accountability*** (A), ***Responsibility*** (R), ***Fairness*** (F)
- Levels of Governance (***CTIA***)
   - ***Corporate (C)*** Governance
   - ***Technology Governance (T)*** - how an organization utilizes technology in its services
   - ***IT Governance (I)*** - TOGAF suggests COBIT framework - Control OBjectives for Information and related Technolog
   - ***Architecture Governance (A)*** (how architectures are managed and controlled within enterprise)

#### Architecture Governance Framework
- An approach, a series of processes, a cultural orientation, and set of owned responsibilities that ensure the integrity of architectures
- **Context** includes Drivers (business, technology, regulatory) and Organizational form
 
   |   **Processes**   |  **Content types**    |  
   | ----------- | ----------- | 
   |  Policy Management and Take-On |  Requirements |
   |  Compliance assessments |   SLA and OLA |
   |  Dispensations |  Authority Structure |
   |  Monitoring and Reporting  |  Organizational Standards |
   |  Business Control  |  Solutions |
   |  Environment Management     |  Architectures |

- An Architecture Governance structure for will typically include Global governance board, Local governance board, Design authorities and Working parties

#### Scoping the Architecture 
- Four dimensions (BDAT) are typically used in order to define and limit the scope of an architecture
   - ***Breadth (B)***: what is the full extent of the enterprise?   
   - ***Depth (D)***: to what level of detail should the architecting effort go?
   - ***Architecture Domains (A)***: a complete EA description should contain all four domains (business, data, application, technology)
   - ***Time Period (T)***: what is the time period that needs to be articulated for the Architecture Vision

#### Architecture Compliance
- ***Irrelevant***- ***No features*** common between specification & implementation
- ***Consistent***- ***Some features*** common between specification & implementation
- ***Compliant***- Some specification features are not implemented, but ***All implemented features AS PER Specification***
- ***Conformant***- All specification features are implemented, but ***Some MORE implemented features NOT PART-OF Specification***
- ***Fully Conformant***- There is ***full correspondence*** between architecture specification and implementation
- ***Non-conformant***-Some features in the architecture specification are implemented not in accordance with the specification

#### Architecture Compliance Review Process
- Architecture compliance review is done at ***Phase G- Implementation Governance***

#### Governance repository Areas of Information
- **Reference Data** (collateral from the organization's own repositories/Enterprise Continuum, including external data; e.g., COBIT, IT4IT)
- **Process Status**: all information regarding the state of any governance processes will be managed
- **Audit Information**: this will record all completed governance process actions and will be used to support
