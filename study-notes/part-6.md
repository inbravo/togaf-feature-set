- Provides a set of reference materials for how to establish such an architecture function
- The structure of Architecture Capability Framework includes
   - Architecture Board
   - Architecture Compliance
   - Architecture Contracts
   - Architecture Governance
   - Architecture Maturity Models
   - Architecture Skills Framework

#### Architecture Capability
- It is an evaludation of your ability to define Enterprise Architecture
- In order to successfully operate an architecture function within an enterprise, it is necessary to put in place appropriate organization structures, processes, roles, responsibilities, and skills to realize the Architecture Capability
- Ability to estabilish the **Architecture Contract** is also the part of the Architecture Capability

#### Architecture Governance
- The practice and orientation by which Enterprise Architectures and other architectures are managed and controlled
- Characteristics or Principles of Good Governance 
   - ***DTIARF***- ***Discipline*** (D), ***Transparency*** (T), ***Independence*** (I), ***Accountability*** (A), ***Responsibility*** (R), ***Fairness*** (F)
- Levels of Governance (***CTIA***)
   - ***Corporate (C)*** Governance
   - ***Technology Governance (T)*** - how an organization utilizes technology in its services
   - ***IT Governance (I)*** - TOGAF suggests COBIT framework - Control OBjectives for Information and related Technolog
   - ***Architecture Governance (A)*** (how architectures are managed and controlled within enterprise)

#### Architecture Governance Framework
- An approach, a series of processes, a cultural orientation, and set of owned responsibilities that ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the organization's architectures

- An Architecture Governance structure for will typically include Global governance board, Local governance board, Design authorities and Working parties

#### Scoping the Architecture 
- Four dimensions (BDAT) are typically used in order to define and limit the scope of an architecture
   - ***Breadth (B)***: what is the full extent of the enterprise?   
   - ***Depth (D)***: to what level of detail should the architecting effort go?
   - ***Architecture Domains (A)***: a complete EA description should contain all four domains (business, data, application, technology)
   - ***Time Period (T)***: what is the time period that needs to be articulated for the Architecture Vision

#### Architecture Compliance
- ***Irrelevant***- ***No features*** common between specification & implementation
- ***Consistent***- ***Some features*** common between specification & implementation
- ***Compliant***- Some specification features are not implemented, but ***All implemented features AS PER Specification***
- ***Conformant***- All specification features are implemented, but ***Some MORE implemented features NOT PART-OF Specification***
- ***Fully Conformant***- There is ***full correspondence*** between architecture specification and implementation
- ***Non-conformant***-Some features in the architecture specification are implemented not in accordance with the specification
