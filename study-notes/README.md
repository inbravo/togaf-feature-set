# TOGAF 101 

## Part 2 - TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM)
- TOGAF ADM is a compresensive method of enterprise architecture (EA) development, based on the best practices 
- TOGAF includes multiple phases to develop various architectures using following iterations
  - ***Architecture Capability (AC) Iteration*** 
  - ***Architecture Development (AD) Iteration*** 
  - ***Transition Planning (TP) Iteration*** 
  - ***Architecture Governance (AG) Iteration***

#### Reasons for Adapting the ADM Process
- The order of the phases in the ADM is dependent on the maturity of the architecture discipline within the enterprise
- Wanting to adapt the ADM is if the TOGAF framework is to be integrated with another enterprise framework
- The ADM is one of the many corporate processes that make up the corporate governance model 
- The ADM is being mandated for use by a prime or lead contractor in an outsourcing situation, and needs to be tailored
- The enterprise is a small-to-medium enterprise, and wishes to use a "cut-down" method 
- The enterprise is very large and complex, and the architecture method needs to be adapted to recognize this
