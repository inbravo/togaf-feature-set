## Enterprise Architecture (EA)
A discipline - 
- That defines, organises, standardizes, and documents the whole architecture and all important elements of the respective organisation, covering relevant domains such as business, digital, physical, or organisational; and 
- The relations and interactions between elements that belong to those domains, such as processes, functions, applications, events, data, or technologies

|      |      |  
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Need | Preparation for business transformation or any radical infrastructure change initiates |
| Purpose  | To optimize across the enterprise the often fragmented legacy of processes into an integrated environment that is responsive to change and supportive of the delivery of the business strategy | 
| Benefits | More effective and efficient **_Business operations_**, Digital Transformation and **_IT operations_**, Better return on  **_Existing Investment_**, Reduced Risk for  **_Future Investment_**, Faster, simpler, and cheaper **_Procurement_** |

## Architecture Framework
- A foundational structure, or set of structures, which can be used for developing different architectures 
- Should describe a method for designing a target state of the enterprise in terms of a set of building blocks
- Should contain a set of tools and provide a common vocabulary 
- Should also include a list of recommended standards and compliant products that can be used to implement the building blocks
- Value of Architecture Framework
   - Systematic ***Codified Common Sense***
   - Avoids the initial panic when the scale of the task becomes apparent and provides a starting point for an architecture project
 
 ## Architecture
 - ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 definition: 
   - _**The fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships, and in the principles of its design and evolution**._
- TOGAF definition: 
   - _**The structure of components, their inter-relationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time**._

## TOGAF Standard
- A Customer Initiative based on the ***Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management*** (TAFIM from US DoD)
- A ***Framework*** not ***Architecture*** to develop architectures to meet different business needs
- TOGAF as Enterprise Architecture (EA) framework
  - TOGAF provides the ***methods and tools*** for assisting in the ***Acceptance***, ***Production***, ***Use***, and ***Maintenance*** (***APUM***) of an EA. 
  - It is based on an ***Iterative Process Model*** supported by best practices and a re-usable set of existing architecture assets.
- TOGAF uses ***Architecture Development Method (ADM)*** to develop an ***Enterprise Architecture (EA)***
- TOGAF Standard helps in creating following Architecture types (BDAT) using ADM
   - ***Business Architecture (B)***: defines the business strategy, governance, organization, and key business processes
   - ***Data Architecture (D)***: describes the structure of an organization's logical and physical data assets and data management resources
   - ***Application Architecture (A)***: provides a blueprint for the applications to be deployed, their interactions, and their relationships to the core business processes

## Principles
- Principles are general rules and guidelines, intended to be enduring and seldom amended, that inform and support the way in which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission
- Depending on the organization, principles may be established within different domains and at different levels
   - ***Enterprise Principles*** provide a basis for decision-making throughout an enterprise
   - ***Architecture Principles*** are a set of principles that relate to architecture work 
   - Five qualities of a good Principle: *** URCCS- Understandable (U), Robust (R), Complete (C), Consistent (C), Stable (S)***
   - Recommended template for Principles
  
|      |      |  
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Name | Should both represent the essence of the rule as well as be easy to remember |
| Statement | Should succinctly and unambiguously communicate the fundamental rule |
| Rationale | Should highlight the business benefits of adhering to the principle, using business terminology |
| Implications | Should highlight the requirements, both for the business and IT, for carrying out the principle |
   
## Architecture Capability
- It is an evaludation of your ability to define Enterprise Architecture
- In order to successfully operate an architecture function within an enterprise, it is necessary to put in place appropriate organization structures, processes, roles, responsibilities, and skills to realize the Architecture Capability
- Ability to estabilish the **Architecture Contract** is also the part of the Architecture Capability

## Architecture Capability Framework
- Provides a set of reference materials for how to establish such an architecture function
- The structure of Architecture Capability Framework includes
   - Architecture Board
   - Architecture Compliance
   - Architecture Contracts
   - Architecture Governance
   - Architecture Maturity Models
   - Architecture Skills Framework

## Architecture Governance
- The practice and orientation by which Enterprise Architectures and other architectures are managed and controlled at an enterprise-wide level
   - Corporate Governance
   - Technology Governance (how an organization utilizes technology in its services)
   - IT Governance (TOGAF suggests COBIT framework - Control OBjectives for Information and related Technology)
   - Architecture Governance (how architectures are managed and controlled within enterprise)

## Architecture Governance Framework
- An approach, a series of processes, a cultural orientation, and set of owned responsibilities that ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the organization's architectures
 
<p align="center"><img src="https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf92-doc/arch/Figures/50_concepts.png" width="700"></p>

- An Architecture Governance structure for will typically include Global governance board, Local governance board, Design authorities and Working parties

<p align="center"><img src="https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf92-doc/arch/Figures/50_org.png" width="700"></p>

## Scoping the Architecture 
- Four dimensions (BDAT) are typically used in order to define and limit the scope of an architecture
   - ***Breadth (B)***: what is the full extent of the enterprise?   
   - ***Depth (D)***: to what level of detail should the architecting effort go?
   - ***Architecture Domains (A)***: a complete EA description should contain all four domains (business, data, application, technology)
   - ***Time Period (T)***: what is the time period that needs to be articulated for the Architecture Vision

## TOGAF Architecture Content Framework (ACF)
- Architects executing the ADM will produce architectural content as a result of their efforts. Some examples
  - Process flows
  - Architectural requirements
  - Project plans 
  - Project compliance assessments etc. 
- ACF provides a ***Structural Model for Architectural Content*** that allows major work products to be ***consistently Defined, Structured, and Presented***.
- ACF uses the following three categories (***DAB***) to describe the type of architectural work product within the context of use:
  - ***Deliverables (D)***
  - ***Artifacts (A)***
  - ***Building Blocks (B)***
    - ***Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs)***
    - ***Solution Building Blocks (SBBs)***   

<p align="center"><img src="https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf92-doc/arch/Figures/02_concepts1.png" width="700"></p>

### Architecture Definition Document (ADD)
- ADD is a deliverable that documents an Architecture Description
- An example of the relationships between deliverables, artifacts, and building blocks is illustrated

<p align="center"><img src="https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf92-doc/arch/Figures/02_concepts2.png" width="700"></p>

## Enterprise Continuum
- The Enterprise Continuum is a view of the repository of all the architecture assets. 
- It can contain architecture descriptions, models, building blocks, patterns, viewpoints, and other artifacts 
- It contains the architectures that exist both within the enterprise and in the IT industry at large
- The Enterprise Continuum enables the organization of re-usable architecture artifacts and solution assets to maximize the enterprise architecture investment opportunities

<p align="center"><img src="https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf92-doc/arch/Figures/39_entcon_oview.png" width="700"></p>

### Architecture Continuum
- The Architecture Continuum illustrates how architectures are developed and evolved across a continuum ranging from Foundation Architectures

<p align="center"><img src="https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf92-doc/arch/Figures/39_archcon.png" width="700"></p>

### Solutions Continuum
- The Solutions Continuum is a population of the architecture with reference building blocks
- The Solutions Continuum represents the detailed specification and construction of the architectures at the corresponding levels of the Architecture Continuum

<p align="center"><img src="https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf92-doc/arch/Figures/39_solcon.png" width="700"></p>

### Architecture Repository
- Operating a mature Architecture Capability within a large enterprise creates a huge volume of architectural output 
- Effective management and leverage of these architectural work products require a formal taxonomy
- At a high level, the following classes of architectural information are expected to be held within an Architecture Repository
   -  ***Architecture Metamodel*** describes the organizationally tailored application of an architecture framework
   -  ***Architecture Capability*** defines the parameters, structures, and processes
   -  ***Architecture Landscape*** presents an architectural representation of assets
   -  ***Standards Information*** Base captures the standards with which new architectures must comply
   -  ***Reference Library*** provides guidelines, templates, patterns, and other forms of reference material
   -  ***Governance Log*** provides a record of governance activity across the enterprise
   -  ***Architecture Requirements Repository*** provides a view of all authorized architecture requirements
   -  ***Solutions Landscape*** presents an architectural representation of the Solution Building Blocks (SBBs)
