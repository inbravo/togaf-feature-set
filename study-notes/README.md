# TOGAF 101 

## Part 2 - TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM)
- TOGAF ADM is a compresensive method of enterprise architecture (EA) development, based on the best practices 
- TOGAF includes multiple phases to develop various architectures using following iterations
  - ***Architecture Capability (AC) Iteration*** 
  - ***Architecture Development (AD) Iteration*** 
  - ***Transition Planning (TP) Iteration*** 
  - ***Architecture Governance (AG) Iteration***

### Approaches to Architecture Development
- ***Baseline First or Bottom-Up Approach*** 
  - This process is most suitable when the baseline is complex, not clearly understood, or agreed upon
  - This approach is common where organizational units have had a high degree of autonomy
- ***Target First or Top-Down Approach*** 
  - This process is suitable when a target state is agreed at a high level and where the enterprise wishes to effectively transition to the target model. 
  - Typically, if the baseline is broadly understood a higher value will be obtained focusing on the target first then baseline to the extent necessary to identify changes

#### Reasons for Adapting the ADM Process
- The order of the phases in the ADM is dependent on the maturity of the architecture discipline within the enterprise
- Wanting to adapt the ADM is if the TOGAF framework is to be integrated with another enterprise framework
- The ADM is one of the many corporate processes that make up the corporate governance model 
- The ADM is being mandated for use by a prime or lead contractor in an outsourcing situation, and needs to be tailored
- The enterprise is a small-to-medium enterprise, and wishes to use a "cut-down" method 
- The enterprise is very large and complex, and the architecture method needs to be adapted to recognize this 

#### Criterian in Assigning a Business Value to Work Package
- ***Performance Evaluation Criteria*** are used by portfolio and capability managers to approve and monitor the progress of the architecture transformation
- ***Return-on-Investment Criteria*** have to be detailed and signed off by the various executive stakeholders
- ***Business Value*** will be used by portfolio and capability managers to allocate resources and, in cases where there are cutbacks, business value in conjunction with return on investment can be used to determine whether an endeavor proceeds, is delayed, or is canceled
- ***Critical Success Factors*** (CSFs) should be established to define success for a project and/or project increment
- ***Measures of Effectiveness*** (MOE) are often performance criteria and many corporations include them in the CSFs
- ***Strategic Fit*** based upon the overall Enterprise Architecture (all tiers) will be the critical factor for allowing the approval of any new project or initiative and for determining the value of any deliverable

#### The Drivers for Change in Change Management Stage (Phase H)
- There are many technology-related drivers for architecture change requests. For example:
  - New technology reports
  - Asset management cost reductions
  - Technology withdrawal
  - Standards initiatives
- In addition there are business drivers for architecture change, including:
  - Business-as-usual developments
  - Business exceptions
  - Business innovations
  - Business technology innovations
  - Strategic change
