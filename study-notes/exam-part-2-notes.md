### Risk Assessment

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 |  You recommend that techniques be used throughout the program to manage risk including risk monitoring. This will enable you to identify, classify, and mitigate the risks associated with the proposed transformation and ensure suitable business continuity plans are in place. In the Implementation Governance phase, you ensure a residual risk assessment is conducted to determine the best way to manage risks that cannot be mitigated. | This is the best answer. ***It summarizes the approach recommended in the TOGAF chapter on Risk Management***. It recognizes that ***risk has to be managed through all ADM phases***, and that ***you need to identify, classify, and mitigate risk before starting a transformation***. In the ***Implementation Governance phase, those residual risks should be understood and managed to the extent possible***. |
| 2 | You recommend that a risk management framework is used in Phase G, the Implementation Governance phase. This would include a risk classification scheme and completion of worksheets for risk assessment. This will enable you to assess the risks associated with the proposed business transformation. You then ensure that the initial level of risk is well understood before issuing the Architecture Contracts. | This choice is ***less correct since it performs No Risk Assessment prior to the Implementation Governance phase***. *** However it provides good guidance on managing the risks using worksheets***. Additionally, ***this answer does not address risk monitoring or the management of residual risks*** |
| 3 | You recommend classifying the risks in terms of time, cost, and scope during the Architecture Vision phase. This will enable you to ensure that certain risks with certain types of impact are managed by the right individuals. You would then ensure that the Architecture Contracts issued in the Implementation Governance phase address those initial risks and include adequate risk monitoring actions to confirm they have been addressed | The TOGAF standard does recommend conducting risk classification in Phase A; however, the classifications being proposed do not address the concerns being put forward. Also this answer does not address the mitigation of risks or residual risk assessment |
