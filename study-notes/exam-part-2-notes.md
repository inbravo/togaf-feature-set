## Part 2 - Exam Helpful Notes

### Risk Assessment

|   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | 
|  
You recommend that techniques be used throughout the program to manage risk including risk monitoring. 
This will enable you to identify, classify, and mitigate the risks associated with the proposed transformation 
and ensure suitable business continuity plans are in place. In the Implementation Governance phase, 
you ensure a residual risk assessment is conducted to determine the best way to manage risks that cannot be mitigated. 
|  
This is the best answer. It summarizes the approach recommended in the TOGAF chapter on Risk Management. 
It recognizes that risk has to be managed through all ADM phases, and that you need to identify, classify, 
and mitigate risk before starting a transformation. In the Implementation Governance phase, 
those residual risks should be understood and managed to the extent possible. |
|
You recommend that a risk management framework is used in Phase G, the Implementation 
Governance phase. This would include a risk classification scheme and completion of worksheets for risk 
assessment. This will enable you to assess the risks associated with the proposed business transformation. 
You then ensure that the initial level of risk is well understood before issuing the Architecture Contracts.
|
This choice is less correct since it performs no Risk Assessment prior to the 
Implementation Governance phase. It provides good guidance on managing the risks 
using worksheets. However, this answer does not address risk monitoring or the 
management of residual risks.
