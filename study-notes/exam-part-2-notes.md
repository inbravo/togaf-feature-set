# Part 2 - Case studies

## Vision Phase (A)

### Case study 1
You are serving as the Lead Architect to a multi-national coffeehouse company. The company is the second largest coffeehouse chain in the world and the largest in the United Kingdom. It currently has over 10,000 stores in 31 countries. The company has a long tradition of innovation, offering its customers a wide range of products and services to attract them to stay longer in their stores. They were one of the first stores to offer free Wi-Fi Internet access across their whole chain.

The company has recently received approval to acquire the fourth largest coffeehouse chain. In order to integrate the new acquisition, an Enterprise Architecture program has been initiated, using the TOGAF standard as the method and guiding framework.

The CIO is the sponsor of the activity. The Chief Architect has indicated that this program should make use of iteration with the ADM. As the program moves into **Phase A** within the **initial iteration of an Architecture Capability cycle**, the CIO has emphasized the need to **ensure that the architecture is embraced across the enterprise**, especially **amongst powerful stakeholders** across both organizations.

You have been asked to explain **how you would ensure that the Architecture Vision responds to the requirements of the stakeholders**.
Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 | You would **conduct a series of business scenarios with the stakeholders impacted by the acquisition**. This will enable you to **discover and document the business requirements** for the merger activity and determine which stakeholders are likely to support or block the initiative. **It will also enable validation of the scope** for the activity. Based on the input you would **develop a high-level description of the Baseline and Target Architectures**. | This is the best answer. **Business scenarios** are the **recommended technique** for developing the Architecture Vision and ensuring that **requirements are identified and validated**. |
| 2 | You would identify all the stakeholders involved in the merger activity, their concerns, and any cultural factors. You would classify their positions and influence, **recording the results in a Stakeholder Map**. You would then focus on the most influential stakeholders ensuring that you **identify the most relevant architecture viewpoints for each stakeholder and validate that their concerns are being addressed**. |  This is **less correct**. **Stakeholder analysis and the development of a Stakeholder Map** is the technique that the **TOGAF standard recommends for identifying and engaging the key stakeholders in Phase A**. However, **running a business scenario would then enable identification and validation of requirements** from the stakeholders |
| 3 | The effective communication of targeted information to the **powerful stakeholders** at the right time is a critical success factor for such a merger. Therefore, you would **develop a Communications Plan to ensure that they are engaged in the program**, are made aware of the key features of the architecture, and have the opportunity to check that their requirements are being addressed. | This answer is **less correct since it focuses only on the powerful stakeholders, and thus could omit key stakeholders** that should be involved. The Communications Plan is produced from the work done by the Stakeholder Management approach suggested in answer A. |

### Case Study 2
Chiamin Metals is a leading world-wide manufacturer for continuous casting and bottom pouring powders. In addition to mould powders, the company also produces cored wire for secondary metallurgy. Chiamin Metals offers a variety of products and uses a paper-based catalog to sponsor them. A new CIO has joint the enterprise and has set up a team of Enterprise Architects following the TOGAF 9 practice.

The main challenge is now to offer to Chiamin Metals customers a centralized and reliable entry point for their request via the implementation of a global online portal. This will allow the management of new marketing activities and will enable the new Chiamin Metals' ecommerce service. 

You are the Chief Architect and the CIO asked you to present an **Architecture Vision** to address the above business problem. Identify the best answer accordingly to the TOGAF 9

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 | You identify key stakeholders, their concerns, and define the key business requirements to be addressed in the architecture engagement and **generate a Stakeholder Map**. You Evaluate business capabilities and execute a **Business Transformation Readiness Assessment**. You apply the **Business Scenarios technique** to **create a high-level view** of the Baseline and Target Architectures also based on the stakeholder concerns, business capability requirements, scope, constraints, and principles. | Best answer. Vision phase has 3 key steps - (1) **Create a Stakeholder Map** (2) **Business Transformation Readiness Assessment** (3) **Business Scenarios Technique to create Architecture Vision** |
| 2 | As requested by the CIO you focus on the **Architecture Vision documentation** and apply the **Business Scenarios technique to create a high-level view of the Baseline and Target Architectures** also based on the stakeholder concerns, business capability requirements, scope, constraints, and principles. | Second best answer, as its **lacking the essential step of creating Stakeholder Map** |
| 3 | You create a high-level view of the Target Architectures and then present them to the CIO. | Third best answer |

## Architecture Maturity and Skills Framework

You are serving as the Lead Architect for a European Insurance company. The company has grown substantially over the last 15 years. Due to the many mergers and acquisitions, the application portfolio of the enterprise has grown with little consideration for consolidation or rationalization. Each business unit has managed its own applications, with no coordination between them. In the last two years the competition in the insurance industry has increased with the advent of many Internet-based comparison sites leading to increased pressure to reduce the operational expenses including IT.

An Enterprise Architecture program has been underway within the company to **integrate and rationalize the application portfolio and introduce a company-wide customer information management system**. A recent review has identified shortcomings within the Enterprise Architecture practice at the company. This has highlighted concerns about the **lack of buy-in to the architecture processes and the Enterprise Architecture program**. **Concerns have also been raised** about **lack of appropriate staff skills and experience** in key roles.

The CIO is the sponsor of the Enterprise Architecture program and the TOGAF standard has been adopted for the architecture method and deliverables. It has been tailored by the Enterprise Architecture team.

The CIO has asked you to recommend an approach to **improve the performance of the Enterprise Architecture practice** within the company.
Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 | You recommend **conducting an Architecture Maturity Assessment** as this will identify the practices on which the company should focus to see the greatest improvement. You also recommend that a **skills framework be introduced**, based on that of the **TOGAF Architecture Skills Framework**. This will provide a clear definition of skills and proficiency levels for roles within the team. | This answer is ***best because it examines the Enterprise Architecture using a technique explicitly designed for assessing process improvement*** for Enterprise Architectures. Second, ***it focuses on assessing the skill levels of the staff by creating an organization specific skills inventory***. |
| 2 | You recommend developing an automated skills assessment tool based on the TOGAF Skills Framework. The tool will provide a rapid means of identifying skills and gaps. The results from running the tool can then be used to determine the training and development needs of the Enterprise Architecture team members and also used when recruiting new team members. | This answer is ***less correct, as it only examines the staff skill levels*** |
| 3 | You would ensure that the IT vision, principles, business linkages, Baseline, and Target Architectures are identified and that a set of architecture standards are being followed. You would recommend that the senior management team are briefed regularly and support the Enterprise Architecture processes. You would ensure that performance metrics associated with the Enterprise Architecture practice are captured and analyzed regularly.  | This answer is ***less correct because it focuses on specific actions to address improving the architecture processes***, but ***lacks application of any techniques to evaluate the processes***. It ***also fails to address staff skills.*** |

## Architecture Compliance Review

You are serving as the Chief Architect for an online grocer, headquartered in Los Angeles, California. After several years of continued profitable operations, the Board of Directors has approved a strategic plan to expand operations to major cities in the Southwestern United States.

To realize this strategy, management has an Enterprise Architecture program in place to plan and implement the rollout which is estimated to take five years to complete. The program needs to consider how to take the current organization, physical plant, and information systems and transform them to support expanded operations.
The TOGAF standard has been adopted as the methodology and framework for the Enterprise Architecture program. The CIO is the sponsor.

A major concern that must be addressed is **how to migrate from a “best-of-breed” logistics system** that was built in the early days. It is not expected that this system will be able to scale to support the expanded operations. The CIO recognizes this and has **an option to purchase a packaged solution from an industry leader** in online sales and fulfillment. One disadvantage of this solution is that **the terminology and definitions of its services do not align well to the current Enterprise Architecture**.
This is now being piloted in a major fulfillment center in Southern California. It is a **large-scale project** and members of your Enterprise Architecture team have been deeply involved with the pilot program.

As part of the pilot program, **the Architecture Board has requested a compliance review** be held at the fulfilment center to determine the status of the implementation. The timing of the compliance review is such that there is still time to correct any major shortcomings with the proposed solution
What approach should you adopt to ensure that the compliance reviews are conducted successfully?
Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 | You assign the lead Enterprise Architect to coordinate the review. You request that **she assemble a team of business and domain experts to conduct the interviews for the review**. She should **review the checklists** that the team has prepared for the interviews to ensure they meet the criteria for the program and the business objectives. She should analyze the completed checklists. The responses to the interviews should then be compiled into a formal report together with recommendations | This is the best answer. It is most appropriate to the situation. **It is a large-scale project** and the Enterprise Architects have been heavily involved. ***In this approach the lead Enterprise Architect coordinates the review and assembles domain experts to manage the reviews***. This ***response includes the mention of checklists and them being reviewed as well*** as a formal report being produced together with recommendations |
| 2 | You delegate the review to the lead Enterprise Architect. You request that she organizes, leads, and conducts the review. Where possible she should involve the appropriate business domain experts. The review should follow the established 12-step process and deliver an assessment report at completion. The report should be presented at the next Architecture Board meeting for acceptance, review, and sign-off | This answer is ***less correct***. This is a reasonable approach, ***usually best done when the architects are not involved in the project***; however, in this case they are. It ***also omits specific mention of the checklists***. |
| 3 | You meet with the project architect and check she clearly understands the purpose of the review. You ask her to run a **lightweight review process** where the architects and team leaders **pose a series of questions to themselves** highlighting their observations on the performance and scalability of the pilot system. The responses should be aggregated into a report. | This answer is less correct. This ***approach is more suited to smaller-scale projects*** and the **informality is not suitable** to such an important project. The aggregation of responses to create the report is incorrect. |

## Risk Assessment

You are serving as the Lead Architect in a multi-national company that operates production facilities in 24 countries and sells its products in over 100 countries. It has three sectors: Transportation, Energy Systems, and Automation. Each sector has several business units that operate independently. An Executive Vice-President heads each of the business units. Traditionally, each business unit has acted independently with few shared customers or suppliers. They were expected to share financial and human resource information from the corporate headquarters.

A consultancy firm has recommended a realignment that will enhance sharing of product information across business units. The implementation of this strategic realignment will require the **development of integrated customer information systems and product information systems**.

The company has a mature Enterprise Architecture practice and uses the TOGAF standard as the basis for its method and deliverables. An architecture development program has been created to address the development of these capabilities and is about to commence. The Enterprise Architecture program is sponsored by the CIO.

At the most recent meeting of the Corporate Board, the Chairman of **the Board expressed a concern about the risk to the business** while a potentially disruptive program is being rolled out across the company. He noted that several competitors had tried similar initiatives with poor results. The **Corporate Board agreed that this concern must be satisfactorily addressed before this program can commence**.
You have been asked to recommend an approach to address the concerns raised.
Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 |  You recommend that techniques be used throughout the program to manage risk including risk monitoring. This will enable you to identify, classify, and mitigate the risks associated with the proposed transformation and ensure suitable business continuity plans are in place. In the Implementation Governance phase, you ensure a residual risk assessment is conducted to determine the best way to manage risks that cannot be mitigated. | This is the best answer. ***It summarizes the approach recommended in the TOGAF chapter on Risk Management***. It recognizes that ***risk has to be managed through all ADM phases***, and that ***you need to identify, classify, and mitigate risk before starting a transformation***. In the ***Implementation Governance phase, those residual risks should be understood and managed to the extent possible***. |
| 2 | You recommend that a **risk management framework is used in Phase G**, the Implementation Governance phase. This would include a risk classification scheme and **completion of worksheets for risk assessment**. This will enable you to assess the risks associated with the proposed business transformation. You then ensure that the initial level of risk is well understood before issuing the Architecture Contracts. | This choice is ***less correct since it performs No Risk Assessment prior to the Implementation Governance phase***. ***However it provides good guidance on managing the risks using worksheets***. Additionally, ***this answer does not address risk monitoring or the management of residual risks*** |
| 3 | You recommend **classifying the risks in terms of time, cost, and scope during the Architecture Vision phase**. This will enable you to ensure that certain risks with certain types of impact are managed by the right individuals. You would then ensure that the Architecture Contracts issued in the Implementation Governance phase address those initial risks and include adequate risk monitoring actions to confirm they have been addressed | The ***TOGAF standard does recommend conducting risk classification in Phase A***; however, the ***classifications being proposed do not address the concerns being put forward***. Also this ***Answer does not address the mitigation of risks or residual risk assessment*** |

## Stakeholder Analysis

You are serving as a consultant to the Chief Architect of a low-cost airline. The airline was formed in 2002 and has its main base at a major international airport on the east coast of North America. It currently serves 65 destinations in 20 US states, and nine countries in the Caribbean, South America, and Latin America.
The airline has received approval to acquire a smaller regional carrier that will extend the market it reaches and enable it to feed its primary routes with connecting flights from smaller cities.

In order to integrate the new acquisition, an Enterprise Architecture program has been initiated, using the TOGAF standard as the method and guiding framework. The CIO is the sponsor of the activity. The Chief Architect has indicated that this program should make use of iteration with the ADM.
As the program moves into **Phase A** within the initial iteration of an Architecture Capability cycle, the CIO has emphasized the need to ensure that the **architecture is embraced across the enterprise**. She noted that **past acquisitions have failed to engage the key players, and this needs to be fully addressed**.

You have been asked to explain **how you would identify and engage the stakeholders at this stage of the program**.
Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 |  You would **identify key stakeholders across both the current airline and the new acquisition**. You would **classify their positions and influence, recording the results in a stakeholder map**. You would then **focus on key stakeholders** ensuring that you identify the most relevant architecture viewpoints for each stakeholder and **validate that their concerns are being addressed**. You would communicate with stakeholders early and frequently, ensuring that they fully understand the architecture process.  | This is the best answer. ***Stakeholder analysis*** and the development of a ***Stakeholder Map*** is the technique that the TOGAF standard recommends for ***identifying and engaging the key stakeholders in Phase A***. ***The Stakeholder Map is a major product output*** and used to support other outputs in this phase. |
| 2 |  You would **conduct a series of business scenarios with the stakeholders** impacted by the acquisition, and determine which stakeholders are likely to block the initiative and which are likely to support it. This would let you identify and understand business needs, and derive the business requirements that the architecture development has to address. You would identify the most relevant architecture viewpoints and validate with the stakeholders. |  This answer is ***less correct since it omits the Stakeholder Map approach*** recommended by the TOGAF standard to explicitly identify stakeholders. ***Business scenarios are an appropriate technique to develop the Architecture Vision*** and can accomplish some of the engagement. This ***answer also lacks the identification of key players*** and the active engagement policy of stakeholder analysis. |

## ADM Preliminary Phase

You are serving as the Lead Architect for a European Insurance company. The company has grown substantially over the last 15 years. Due to the many mergers and acquisitions, the application portfolio of the enterprise has grown significantly with little consideration for consolidation or rationalization. Each business unit has managed its own applications, with no coordination between them. In the last two years the competition in the insurance industry has increased with the advent of many Internet-based comparison sites leading to increased pressure to reduce the operational expenses including IT.

The Corporate Board has approved the directive to establish an Enterprise Architecture program within the company to **integrate and rationalize the application portfolio and introduce a company-wide customer information management system**. The Corporate Board has also given a strategic direction that the company should expand its markets significantly to cover all the member country states of the European Union in the next 24 months.

The **company has no existing Enterprise Architecture**. The CIO is the sponsor of the program and has mandated the TOGAF standard for the architecture method and deliverables. The CIO has established an Architecture Board and called the first meeting.
You have been asked **how you will establish the Enterprise Architecture program**.
Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 |  You ensure that there is agreement on the scope of the Enterprise Architecture, and identify the key business drivers. You document and validate the requirements for architecture work. You develop a set of Architecture Principles with the Architecture Board to guide the architecture work. You then consider how to best tailor the TOGAF framework for use, and identify tools for supporting the program | This is the ***best answer***. It ***follows the procedures outlined in the Preliminary Phase***. As ***this is establishing the program, these are the key steps for this phase***. |
| 2 |  You work with the Architecture Board to develop and tailor the TOGAF framework, so it can be integrated with the existing procedures established by the Program Management Office. In addition, you examine the relationship to other processes and frameworks for systems development, operations management, and governance. You then conduct a study to determine the footprint of the Enterprise Architecture.  | This choice is ***less correct as it misses out scoping, identifying drivers, and developing principles*** that would be very much needed in this establishment situation. |
| 3 | You start by conducting an Architecture Maturity Assessment to assess the ability of the company to undergo change. Using that input you then apply the TOGAF ADM to define the overall requirements for integrating a new company information management system into the enterprise. You then work with the Architecture Board to define the business goals that will drive the Enterprise Architecture program.  | This choice can be performed as part of the Preliminary Phase, but ***it is not the immediate priority as the scenario is program establishment***. This ***omits key items, such as scoping the enterprise and establishing principles***, and moves forward to apply the ADM before that program establishment is completed | 

## ADM Architecture Phases (Phases B-C-D)

You are working as the Lead Enterprise Architecture for a global manufacturing firm. The firm has decided to improve the efficiency of its sales force by replacing its legacy fax and paper-based configuration and ordering systems with a hand-held device solution. This will impact both the firm and its suppliers.

The firm uses the TOGAF framework for the internal Enterprise Architecture and uses an iterative approach to applying the ADM. The Enterprise Architecture team has established the Architecture Capability for this project and also completed the first iteration of the Architecture Definition cycle, using a Baseline First approach. The CIO is the sponsor of the Enterprise Architecture program.

The initial iteration has established the approach, the scope, and vision for the project. A set of Architecture Principles has been established based on the example set provided in the TOGAF standard. The CIO has highlighted the importance of adhering to the following principles:
- Data is an asset
- Data is shared
- Data is accessible

The initial iteration has also established a number of business goals and objectives for the new target system. The principal goal is to give the sales force in the field direct access to the sales process, allowing sales staff to create and verify product configurations, check pricing and availability, and to place an order while still on the client site with the customer. As part of achieving this goal, the architectures developed will need to address the following stakeholder concerns:
- **What changes to existing business processes** are needed?
- **What data will need to be shared**?
- **How will distributed data be secured**?
- **What non-sales applications will need to be integrated** with any new sales applications?

You have been asked to identify the most appropriate artifacts (catalogs, matrices, and diagrams) for the second iteration of the Architecture Development Cycle. Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 |  Describe the Business Architecture with a Process/Event/Control/Product catalog and Role catalog. <br/> Describe the Data Architecture with a Data Entity/Data Component catalog, Application/Data matrix, and Data Security diagram. <br/> Describe the Application Architecture with an Interface catalog. <br/> Describe the Technology Architecture with a Networked Computing/Hardware diagram. <br/> |  This is the ***Best Answer***. The ***Process/Event/Control/Product Catalog*** allows an enterprise to identify the full chain of impacts resulting from changing a high-level process (***addressing concern -"What changes to existing business processes are needed?"***). <br/> The ***Data Entity/Data Component catalog and Application/Data matrix address concern 2 ("What data will need to be shared?")***. <br/> The ***Data Security diagram and Networked Computing/Hardware diagram would address concern 3 ("How will distributed data be secured?")***. <br/> A Role catalog can be used also to support the security definition for the enterprise (addressing concern 3).  <br/> The ***Interface catalog*** allows the interaction between applications to be developed and so ***will address concern 4 ("What non-sales applications will need to be integrated with any new sales applications?")***   | 
| 2 | Describe the Business Architecture with a Location catalog and Role catalog. <br/> Describe the Data Architecture with a Data Entity/Business Function matrix, Application/Data matrix, and Data Security diagram. Describe the Application Architecture with an Application Interaction matrix. <br/> Describe the Technology Architecture with a Networked Computing/Hardware diagram.  |  This choice is ***less good*** since it ***does not address concern 1*** explicitly. <br/> The architecture viewpoints selected address the other concerns. Note that the ***Application Interaction matrix is the matrix equivalent of the Interface catalog***  |
| 3 | Describe the Business Architecture with a Location catalog and Business Footprint diagram. <br/> Describe the Data Architecture with a Application/Data matrix, Data Migration diagram, and Data Lifecycle diagram. <br/> Describe the Application Architecture with an Application Communication diagram. <br/> Describe the Technology Architecture with a Networked Computing/Hardware diagram. |  ***This choice as well as not addressing concern 1***, falls short on defining roles to aid security (concern 3), Data Sharing (concern 2), and Data Security (concern 3) compared to the most correct answer.  |

## ADM Opportunities and Solutions (Phase E)

You are serving as the Lead Enterprise Architect for a major bank, leading a group of domain architects as well as working with the corporate project management office, strategic planners, and operations management planners. The bank has been in business for over 60 years, growing through a series of acquisitions with other financial institutions. It has a large IT service department and routinely has over 100 infrastructure and service projects in progress. The Governing Board has decided that a more structured approach to its infrastructure and services is necessary to safeguard the business, especially given the recent turmoil in the financial markets.

As a result, the CIO has sponsored the creation of an Enterprise Architecture group. This group has adopted the TOGAF 9 standard as the basis for its Enterprise Architecture, developed an Architecture Vision, which has been approved, and defined a set of domain architectures. The time has come to **consolidate the domain architectures** and review the current initiatives and projects in the corporate portfolio as well as potentially create new projects in order to realize the vision.

The CIO has stated that the implementation approach must accommodate the constantly occurring changes to the technology and business landscapes. Shareholders want to see not just a vision but want to know that there is a flexible, **integrated Implementation and Migration Plan** that has the best chance of realizing the vision in these uncertain times.
A meeting has been scheduled with the stakeholders and you have been asked to recommend the best approach to address the concerns raised.
Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 | You recommend development of a series of Transition Architectures. This can then deliver continuous business value in an incremental manner, achieved by all the projects delivering their increments in a coordinated approach based on capability planning. You will consolidate the gap analysis results from each of the domain architectures and analyze the dependencies so as to come up with a work-breakdown structure. You will examine what is achievable and identify logical work packages that can become the basis for projects or the leveraging of existing projects. You will then hold a series of facilitated sessions to seek consensus on the Implementation and Migration Strategy. | This is the best answer. It recommends the use of ***Transition Architectures and Capability Increments to deliver Business Value*** which addresses the concern that the implementation has the ability to accommodate changes to technology and business landscape. It describes the ***Migration Planning techniques to deliver Transition Architectures***, as well as ***Seeking consensus input on the Implementation and Migration Strategy rather than going straight to an Implementation and Migration Plan*** |
| 2 | You recommend that the Enterprise Architecture team leverage all of the existing projects and their deliverables to address the findings from the gap analysis results for the architecture domains. The Enterprise Architecture team will request from the stakeholders all of the existing project charters and architectures so that the architects can integrate them together in a coherent manner. They will inform the operations management staff of their plans so that they can prepare to support the deliverables. Each of the domain architects will then come up with specific projects to address their gaps and then consider whether existing projects need to have their scope revised. The sum of the work required in each of the domains will then be consolidated into the Implementation and Migration Plan. The timeline for progression of deliverables will be documented in the Architecture Roadmap | This is a ***less correct approach that addresses the deliverables of the architectures but in an uncoordinated way***. It looks at ***rolling up the work in each domain rather than consolidating the gaps and creating projects as a function of capability management***. It ***also does not directly describe the use of Transition Architectures***. It does describe the role of the Implementation and Migration Plan and the Architecture Roadmap accurately. |
| 3 | You recommend that the stakeholders provide input on what has to be done to implement the defined domain architectures. The intent is to ensure that all stakeholders will be allowed to contribute to the Enterprise Architecture planning. The joint analysis will then result in a detailed list of work activities that will be rolled into an IT portfolio plan that will eventually give rise to a series of projects. The intent is to create a comprehensive Target Architecture that will include the detailed technology choices for the organization for the next five years. A full report will be completed highlighting what was done including a detailed dependencies and factors assessment | This is ***less correct*** as it focuses on a detailed technology-based Implementation and Migration Plan, ***Negating the impact of using Transition Architectures to deliver Incremental Business Value*** that could absorb technology and business environment change. |

## ADM Migration Planning (Phase F)

### Case study 1
You are serving as the Lead Architect for a telecommunications company that recently formed through the merging of three other telecommunication companies. The business operating model has been unified, and an Enterprise Architecture program has been put in place as part of the integration of the three organizations.

The company has adopted the TOGAF 9 Architecture Development Method. The Architecture Board has approved the outline Implementation and Migration Plan and they are now at the stage of conducting detailed migration planning. A working group has been formed that involves all the key architects and the stakeholders from the corporate matrix (those who will work on the project).

It is recognized that others outside the Enterprise Architecture team will have the responsibility to fund, build, support, and use what is put in place based on the Enterprise Architecture. For the company, getting this right is critical especially as the competition in the marketplace has been fierce and the lines of business have been resistant to implementing any new business model.

The CIO is the sponsor of the program and has mandated an increment approach to rollout the integration program. You have been asked to describe:
- **How you would conduct migration planning**
- **What you would be implementing**
- **Who you would involve**
- **What would be the major deliverable(s)**
Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 | **Migration planning** should be conducted by the Enterprise Architecture team. The approach should be confirmed and **coordinated with the corporate management frameworks** involved. Detailed **resource estimates** should be created for the work to be completed and the business value identified for all deliverables. A series of **Transition Architectures** should be planned that take into account the priorities. When this is completed the Implementation and Migration Plan can be finalized. The **Business Planning, Portfolio Management, and Operations Management groups should all be involved** in the development of the major deliverables. Once the deliverables have been completed, the Architecture Development Cycle should be completed. | This is the best answer. The answer is concise and complete as per Phase F, with ***an emphasis on building corporate consensus and ensuring that the Transition Architectures are solidly based upon business value***. |
| 2 |  Migration planning should be conducted by the Enterprise Architecture team, in particular the domain (Business, Application, Data, Technology, and Security) architects who would look at implementing a series of Transition Architectures using **sound** project management techniques. The Enterprise Architecture team will then create a prioritized list of activities and place the high-level Architecture Building Blocks in an Implementation and Migration Plan and Architecture Roadmap. These deliverables would be circulated around the organization for comments that would be selectively integrated. The circulation would be to the lines of business and the members of the Executive Board so that they would be ready to fund the proposed Enterprise Architecture work | This is a less correct approach, as ***it is incomplete, missing key steps of Phase F***. This also ***lacks the collaborative planning in close cooperation with the stakeholders within and outside of the organization***. |
| 3 | Migration planning should be conducted by the Chief Architect, his direct reports, and shared with the domain architects. When complete, the Implementation and Migration Plan will be sent to the Architecture Board for approval at their next meeting. The plan will include a prioritized list of projects, their approximate cost, and the recommended way ahead. Comments from the Board (and their staff) would be incorporated into the plan and then the individual projects would have to go in front of the Board to secure approval for project resources for the next project increment. The Implementation and Migration Plan would include a high-level GANNT chart that could be used as the Architecture Roadmap. | The approach is also incomplete. ***Phase F emphasizes collaborative planning in close cooperation with the stakeholders within and outside of the organization***, and this lacks that approach. |

### Case study 2
You are serving as the Lead Architect for a telecommunications company that recently formed through the merging of three other telecommunication companies. The business operating model has been unified, and an Enterprise Architecture program has been put in place to manage the integration of the three organizations.

The company has adopted the TOGAF 9 Architecture Development Method. It has successfully completed the architecture definition phases of an ADM cycle and has identified a large collection of candidate roadmap components. The CIO is the sponsor of the program. **She is concerned about the risks to the existing revenue lines** and would also like to **ensure that the most cost-beneficial projects are undertaken first**.

The Architecture **Board has approved the draft Architecture Definition Document and they are now at the stage of conducting migration planning**. A working group has been formed that involves all the key architects and the stakeholders from the corporate matrix (those who will work on the project).

You have been asked to recommend **how they can identify and prioritize the projects from these roadmap components**, taking account of the CIO’s concerns.
Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 | Review and consolidate the gap analysis results from Phases B, C, and D by making use of the **Consolidated Gaps, Solutions, and Dependencies matrix**. Rationalize the gap analysis and identify dependencies. Group the activities into a coherent set of projects. Use the **Business Value Assessment Technique to assign a business value to each project**, taking account of value and risk factors. Prioritize the projects into a Migration Plan taking account of **dependencies, cost/benefit analysis, and risk**. | This is the most straightforward approach, ***selecting just two of the migration planning techniques, relevant to project identification and prioritization, risk, and cost/benefit analysis***. This most addresses the CIO concern of risk and cost/benefit. |
| 2 |  Create a list of all possible projects from the gap analysis results of Phases B, C, and D. Use the Business Value Assessment Technique to assign a business value to each project, taking account of value and risk factors. Prioritize the projects into a Migration Plan, taking account of dependencies, cost/benefit analysis, and risk. Create an Architecture Definition Increments Table showing how a series of Transition Architectures may be implemented to achieve the Migration Plan. | This is similar to answer C; ***C is slightly better because the Consolidated Gaps, Solutions, and Dependencies matrix identifies possible duplicated projects earlier*** and is a more rigorous approach than just creating a list of the projects. It ***also addresses the concerns of risk and cost/benefit analysis***. |
| 3 | Use the Implementation Factor Assessment and Deduction matrix to document factors impacting the Migration Plan; use the Consolidated Gaps, Solutions, and Dependencies matrix to consolidate the gaps from Phases B, C, and D; use the Transition Architecture State Evolution Table to show the proposed state of the architectures at various levels; use the Business Value Assessment Technique to analyze the relative value and risk of each proposed project; and use the Architecture Definition Increments Table to show the proposed series of Transition Architectures. | This is ***less correct – it uses all the migration planning techniques available*** but without showing understanding of what each technique is used for. It is just a list of the techniques |

## Implementation Governance (Phase G)

You are serving as the Lead Architect for a business unit within a major logistics company. The business unit has selected a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Market Analytics solution in order to improve its capability to respond to market demands for its new rail-based freight delivery service. It has been identified that the current system does not provide the required functionality to support the marketing activities. Its performance limitations cause unacceptable delays and missed opportunities to meet market targets. Clearly, the current system is costing the business unit in terms of lost revenue.

The company has a mature Enterprise Architecture capability spanning all of its business units and has adapted the TOGAF framework as the basis for its ongoing program. The CIO is the sponsor of the Enterprise Architecture practice.

The Enterprise Architecture team initiated a project with the business unit that has defined the business vision and requirements for the new system. It includes a detailed business process analysis. A solution has been proposed that can support the existing applications and technologies currently in place. The proposed solution requires a non-standard operating system platform to support the business application and also requires different web server software to the current supported web server solutions. The Architecture Board has held a review, and it was noted that some of these project requirements were not consistent with the company’s current infrastructure standards.

After discussions with several senior executives, the CIO feels that he must support the business unit’s urgent need to deploy the Market Analytics package. He has approved the implementation. A project manager has been chosen, and a feasibility meeting has been held with a decision to move forward. The project is critical and must be completed as quickly as possible; a contract has been signed with the software vendor to implement the solution.

The vendor has provided a statement of work that has passed through the migration planning phase, and major impacts to existing systems and the infrastructure have been documented.
The CIO has asked the Enterprise Architecture team to **prepare for Phase G**, ensuring that **the key performance indicators for system performance and security are met**, and the project remains within budget.
You have been asked to recommend a plan to implement the direction from the CIO.
Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 | You review the output from the Architecture Board and recommend the co-existence of a second web server standard, noting the additional hardware and support skills issues. You add this technology to the currently supported inventory of standard products in the company Standards Information Base. You direct the project architects to construct an Architecture Contract with the development team. You emphasize the importance of using appropriate architecture compliance reviews in addition to the test plans required for performance, and monitor the testing results. You establish agreements with the business unit for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) and delivery dates. After implementation, you identify re-usable objects and procedures. | This is the best answer. All of the criteria fall within Phase G. The architect accepts the mandate of the CIO and decides that a second standard is an acceptable compromise, since time is of the essence and a contract has already been signed with the vendor per his product design. The architect then works with the development team to draw up an Architecture Contract. The architect emphasizes use of compliance reviews, the testing of the performance as the solution is developed (a critical user requirement), and gets buy-in and visibility of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and schedule with the business unit. Finally, after implementation, re-useable artifacts and objects are collected and are available for future projects. |
| 2 | Based on the review held by the Architecture Board, you recommend the vendor modify the web server software and hardware components in the product so they can meet the current infrastructure standards. You recommend development of an in-house prototype of the product to investigate coding change options. You would then obtain the approval of the development leads for supporting the development effort, develop an Architecture Contract, and provide the project plan to the project manager, emphasizing adherence to schedule. After implementation, you schedule frequent operational reviews to monitor performance of the solution.|  This answer is less correct as the response (to recommend the vendor change the product) may take time and, as noted in the scenario, this is a time-critical project. Performing a prototype would reduce the risk, but again at the expense of time and perhaps budget. The project plan should be drawn up by the project manager not the architect. Finally, performance is paramount, yet the architect is suggesting monitoring the performance after implementation, rather than testing the product’s performance before implementation. |
| 3 | You prepare an expanded risk analysis and inform the development team of the required deliverables and the dates. You prepare a detailed impact analysis of the use of a “non-standard” web and hardware solution. You construct an Architecture Contract. You obtain approval from the CIO prior to implementation. You schedule a test of the solution just prior to implementation according to user performance requirements. You deliver the required artifacts and archive them when implementation is completed | This approach follows the CIO direction but focuses on risk rather than co-existence. There is no negotiation with the implementation team – just a handover of schedules – or with the business unit regarding service levels. The suggestion to test the solution just prior to implementation is too late, since the solution has already been constructed and any surprises will likely impact schedule and budget. The attention to artifacts is superfluous.  |

## Data Architecture (Phase C)

UTrack Transports is a strong UK logistics company. The head of the strategic marketing division engaged the Principal Architect issuing a Request for architectural work to design an enhancement of the current Enterprise Data Warehouse system.

An enhancement is needed to support the change in the business model; UTrack wants to leverage on customer data collected during business as usual activities and anonymize them to offer marketing agencies a fresh and accessible source of analytics data, this will increase the company revenues. TOGAF 9 is the architectural framework in use.

Refer to the scenario above The Principal Architect has decided to ask you as Business Intelligence Subject Matter Expert to **design the Data Architecture**. The Chief Architect shared with you the Architecture Definition Document including the Business Architecture design.

You now need to choose the artifacts you want to produce as part of the Data Architecture design. Identify the best answer accordingly to the TOGAF 9. 

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 | You first list the data used across the enterprise using a Data Entity/Data Component Catalog, including data entities and also the data components where data entities are stored. You then classify what the data source are and the **relationship** with the data entities via a System/Data Matrix. You finally identify common data requirements using a Data Lifecycle Diagram. | Best answer. **Matrix is used to showcase the relationship not a catalog**. |
| 2 | You first list the data used across the enterprise using a Data Entity/Data Component Matrix, including data entities and also the data components where data entities are stored. You then classify what the data source are and the relationship with the data entities via a Role/System Catalog. You finally identify common data requirements using a Data Use Case Diagram. | |
| 3 | You first list the data used across the enterprise using a Data Entity/Data Component Catalog, including data entities and also the data components where data entities are stored. You then classify what the data source are and the relationship with the data entities via a System/Data Matrix. | |
| 4 | You first list the data used across the enterprise using a Data Entity/Data Component Catalog, including data entities and also the data components where data entities are stored. You then assign ownership of data entities to the organization via a System/Data Matrix. | |
