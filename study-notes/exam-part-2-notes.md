# Part 2 - Exam Helpful Notes

## Risk Assessment

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 |  You recommend that techniques be used throughout the program to manage risk including risk monitoring. This will enable you to identify, classify, and mitigate the risks associated with the proposed transformation and ensure suitable business continuity plans are in place. In the Implementation Governance phase, you ensure a residual risk assessment is conducted to determine the best way to manage risks that cannot be mitigated. | This is the best answer. ***It summarizes the approach recommended in the TOGAF chapter on Risk Management***. It recognizes that ***risk has to be managed through all ADM phases***, and that ***you need to identify, classify, and mitigate risk before starting a transformation***. In the ***Implementation Governance phase, those residual risks should be understood and managed to the extent possible***. |
| 2 | You recommend that a risk management framework is used in Phase G, the Implementation Governance phase. This would include a risk classification scheme and completion of worksheets for risk assessment. This will enable you to assess the risks associated with the proposed business transformation. You then ensure that the initial level of risk is well understood before issuing the Architecture Contracts. | This choice is ***less correct since it performs No Risk Assessment prior to the Implementation Governance phase***. ***However it provides good guidance on managing the risks using worksheets***. Additionally, ***this answer does not address risk monitoring or the management of residual risks*** |
| 3 | You recommend classifying the risks in terms of time, cost, and scope during the Architecture Vision phase. This will enable you to ensure that certain risks with certain types of impact are managed by the right individuals. You would then ensure that the Architecture Contracts issued in the Implementation Governance phase address those initial risks and include adequate risk monitoring actions to confirm they have been addressed | The ***TOGAF standard does recommend conducting risk classification in Phase A***; however, the ***classifications being proposed do not address the concerns being put forward***. Also this ***Answer does not address the mitigation of risks or residual risk assessment*** |

## Stakeholder Analysis

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 |  You would identify key stakeholders across both the current airline and the new acquisition. You would classify their positions and influence, recording the results in a stakeholder map. You would then focus on key stakeholders ensuring that you identify the most relevant architecture viewpoints for each stakeholder and validate that their concerns are being addressed. You would communicate with stakeholders early and frequently, ensuring that they fully understand the architecture process.  | This is the best answer. ***Stakeholder analysis*** and the development of a ***Stakeholder Map*** is the technique that the TOGAF standard recommends for ***identifying and engaging the key stakeholders in Phase A***. ***The Stakeholder Map is a major product output*** and used to support other outputs in this phase. |
| 2 |  You would conduct a series of business scenarios with the stakeholders impacted by the acquisition, and determine which stakeholders are likely to block the initiative and which are likely to support it. This would let you identify and understand business needs, and derive the business requirements that the architecture development has to address. You would identify the most relevant architecture viewpoints and validate with the stakeholders. |  This answer is ***less correct since it omits the Stakeholder Map approach*** recommended by the TOGAF standard to explicitly identify stakeholders. ***Business scenarios are an appropriate technique to develop the Architecture Vision*** and can accomplish some of the engagement. This ***answer also lacks the identification of key players*** and the active engagement policy of stakeholder analysis. |

## ADM Preliminary Phase

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 |  You ensure that there is agreement on the scope of the Enterprise Architecture, and identify the key business drivers. You document and validate the requirements for architecture work. You develop a set of Architecture Principles with the Architecture Board to guide the architecture work. You then consider how to best tailor the TOGAF framework for use, and identify tools for supporting the program | This is the ***best answer***. It ***follows the procedures outlined in the Preliminary Phase***. As ***this is establishing the program, these are the key steps for this phase***. |
| 2 |  You work with the Architecture Board to develop and tailor the TOGAF framework, so it can be integrated with the existing procedures established by the Program Management Office. In addition, you examine the relationship to other processes and frameworks for systems development, operations management, and governance. You then conduct a study to determine the footprint of the Enterprise Architecture.  | This choice is ***less correct as it misses out scoping, identifying drivers, and developing principles*** that would be very much needed in this establishment situation. |
| 3 | You start by conducting an Architecture Maturity Assessment to assess the ability of the company to undergo change. Using that input you then apply the TOGAF ADM to define the overall requirements for integrating a new company information management system into the enterprise. You then work with the Architecture Board to define the business goals that will drive the Enterprise Architecture program.  | This choice can be performed as part of the Preliminary Phase, but ***it is not the immediate priority as the scenario is program establishment***. This ***omits key items, such as scoping the enterprise and establishing principles***, and moves forward to apply the ADM before that program establishment is completed | 

## ADM Architecture Phases (Phases B-C-D)

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 |  Describe the Business Architecture with a Process/Event/Control/Product catalog and Role catalog. <br/> Describe the Data Architecture with a Data Entity/Data Component catalog, Application/Data matrix, and Data Security diagram. <br/> Describe the Application Architecture with an Interface catalog. <br/> Describe the Technology Architecture with a Networked Computing/Hardware diagram. <br/> |  This is the ***Best Answer***. The ***Process/Event/Control/Product Catalog*** allows an enterprise to identify the full chain of impacts resulting from changing a high-level process (***addressing concern -"What changes to existing business processes are needed?"***). <br/> The ***Data Entity/Data Component catalog and Application/Data matrix address concern 2 ("What data will need to be shared?")***. <br/> The ***Data Security diagram and Networked Computing/Hardware diagram would address concern 3 ("How will distributed data be secured?")***. <br/> A Role catalog can be used also to support the security definition for the enterprise (addressing concern 3).  <br/> The ***Interface catalog*** allows the interaction between applications to be developed and so ***will address concern 4 ("What non-sales applications will need to be integrated with any new sales applications?")***   | 
| 2 | Describe the Business Architecture with a Location catalog and Role catalog. <br/> Describe the Data Architecture with a Data Entity/Business Function matrix, Application/Data matrix, and Data Security diagram. Describe the Application Architecture with an Application Interaction matrix. <br/> Describe the Technology Architecture with a Networked Computing/Hardware diagram.  |  This choice is ***less good*** since it ***does not address concern 1*** explicitly. <br/> The architecture viewpoints selected address the other concerns. Note that the ***Application Interaction matrix is the matrix equivalent of the Interface catalog***  |
| 3 | Describe the Business Architecture with a Location catalog and Business Footprint diagram. <br/> Describe the Data Architecture with a Application/Data matrix, Data Migration diagram, and Data Lifecycle diagram. <br/> Describe the Application Architecture with an Application Communication diagram. <br/> Describe the Technology Architecture with a Networked Computing/Hardware diagram. |  ***This choice as well as not addressing concern 1***, falls short on defining roles to aid security (concern 3), Data Sharing (concern 2), and Data Security (concern 3) compared to the most correct answer.  |

## ADM Architecture Phases (Phases B-C-D) and Opportunities and Solutions (Phase E)

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 | You recommend development of a series of Transition Architectures. This can then deliver continuous business value in an incremental manner, achieved by all the projects delivering their increments in a coordinated approach based on capability planning. You will consolidate the gap analysis results from each of the domain architectures and analyze the dependencies so as to come up with a work-breakdown structure. You will examine what is achievable and identify logical work packages that can become the basis for projects or the leveraging of existing projects. You will then hold a series of facilitated sessions to seek consensus on the Implementation and Migration Strategy. | This is the best answer. It recommends the use of ***Transition Architectures and Capability Increments to deliver Business Value*** which addresses the concern that the implementation has the ability to accommodate changes to technology and business landscape. It describes the ***Migration Planning techniques to deliver Transition Architectures***, as well as ***Seeking consensus input on the Implementation and Migration Strategy rather than going straight to an Implementation and Migration Plan*** |
| 2 | You recommend that the Enterprise Architecture team leverage all of the existing projects and their deliverables to address the findings from the gap analysis results for the architecture domains. The Enterprise Architecture team will request from the stakeholders all of the existing project charters and architectures so that the architects can integrate them together in a coherent manner. They will inform the operations management staff of their plans so that they can prepare to support the deliverables. Each of the domain architects will then come up with specific projects to address their gaps and then consider whether existing projects need to have their scope revised. The sum of the work required in each of the domains will then be consolidated into the Implementation and Migration Plan. The timeline for progression of deliverables will be documented in the Architecture Roadmap | This is a ***less correct approach that addresses the deliverables of the architectures but in an uncoordinated way***. It looks at ***rolling up the work in each domain rather than consolidating the gaps and creating projects as a function of capability management***. It ***also does not directly describe the use of Transition Architectures***. It does describe the role of the Implementation and Migration Plan and the Architecture Roadmap accurately. |
| 3 | You recommend that the stakeholders provide input on what has to be done to implement the defined domain architectures. The intent is to ensure that all stakeholders will be allowed to contribute to the Enterprise Architecture planning. The joint analysis will then result in a detailed list of work activities that will be rolled into an IT portfolio plan that will eventually give rise to a series of projects. The intent is to create a comprehensive Target Architecture that will include the detailed technology choices for the organization for the next five years. A full report will be completed highlighting what was done including a detailed dependencies and factors assessment | This is ***less correct*** as it focuses on a detailed technology-based Implementation and Migration Plan, ***Negating the impact of using Transition Architectures to deliver Incremental Business Value*** that could absorb technology and business environment change. |

## ADM Migration Planning (Phase F)

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 | Migration planning should be conducted by the Enterprise Architecture team. The approach should be confirmed and coordinated with the corporate management frameworks involved. Detailed resource estimates should be created for the work to be completed and the business value identified for all deliverables. A series of Transition Architectures should be planned that take into account the priorities. When this is completed the Implementation and Migration Plan can be finalized. The Business Planning, Portfolio Management, and Operations Management groups should all be involved in the development of the major deliverables. Once the deliverables have been completed, the Architecture Development Cycle should be completed. | This is the best answer. The answer is concise and complete as per Phase F, with ***an emphasis on building corporate consensus and ensuring that the Transition Architectures are solidly based upon business value***. |
| 2 |  Migration planning should be conducted by the Enterprise Architecture team, in particular the domain (Business, Application, Data, Technology, and Security) architects who would look at implementing a series of Transition Architectures using sound project management techniques. The Enterprise Architecture team will then create a prioritized list of activities and place the high-level Architecture Building Blocks in an Implementation and Migration Plan and Architecture Roadmap. These deliverables would be circulated around the organization for comments that would be selectively integrated. The circulation would be to the lines of business and the members of the Executive Board so that they would be ready to fund the proposed Enterprise Architecture work | This is a less correct approach, as ***it is incomplete, missing key steps of Phase F***. This also ***lacks the collaborative planning in close cooperation with the stakeholders within and outside of the organization***. |
| 3 | Migration planning should be conducted by the Chief Architect, his direct reports, and shared with the domain architects. When complete, the Implementation and Migration Plan will be sent to the Architecture Board for approval at their next meeting. The plan will include a prioritized list of projects, their approximate cost, and the recommended way ahead. Comments from the Board (and their staff) would be incorporated into the plan and then the individual projects would have to go in front of the Board to secure approval for project resources for the next project increment. The Implementation and Migration Plan would include a high-level GANNT chart that could be used as the Architecture Roadmap. | The approach is also incomplete. ***Phase F emphasizes collaborative planning in close cooperation with the stakeholders within and outside of the organization***, and this lacks that approach. |

## Implementation Governance (Phase G)

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 | You review the output from the Architecture Board and recommend the co-existence of a second web server standard, noting the additional hardware and support skills issues. You add this technology to the currently supported inventory of standard products in the company Standards Information Base. You direct the project architects to construct an Architecture Contract with the development team. You emphasize the importance of using appropriate architecture compliance reviews in addition to the test plans required for performance, and monitor the testing results. You establish agreements with the business unit for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) and delivery dates. After implementation, you identify re-usable objects and procedures. | This is the best answer. All of the criteria fall within Phase G. The architect accepts the mandate of the CIO and decides that a second standard is an acceptable compromise, since time is of the essence and a contract has already been signed with the vendor per his product design. The architect then works with the development team to draw up an Architecture Contract. The architect emphasizes use of compliance reviews, the testing of the performance as the solution is developed (a critical user requirement), and gets buy-in and visibility of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and schedule with the business unit. Finally, after implementation, re-useable artifacts and objects are collected and are available for future projects. |
| 2 | Based on the review held by the Architecture Board, you recommend the vendor modify the web server software and hardware components in the product so they can meet the current infrastructure standards. You recommend development of an in-house prototype of the product to investigate coding change options. You would then obtain the approval of the development leads for supporting the development effort, develop an Architecture Contract, and provide the project plan to the project manager, emphasizing adherence to schedule. After implementation, you schedule frequent operational reviews to monitor performance of the solution.|  This answer is less correct as the response (to recommend the vendor change the product) may take time and, as noted in the scenario, this is a time-critical project. Performing a prototype would reduce the risk, but again at the expense of time and perhaps budget. The project plan should be drawn up by the project manager not the architect. Finally, performance is paramount, yet the architect is suggesting monitoring the performance after implementation, rather than testing the product’s performance before implementation. |
| 3 | You prepare an expanded risk analysis and inform the development team of the required deliverables and the dates. You prepare a detailed impact analysis of the use of a “non-standard” web and hardware solution. You construct an Architecture Contract. You obtain approval from the CIO prior to implementation. You schedule a test of the solution just prior to implementation according to user performance requirements. You deliver the required artifacts and archive them when implementation is completed | This approach follows the CIO direction but focuses on risk rather than co-existence. There is no negotiation with the implementation team – just a handover of schedules – or with the business unit regarding service levels. The suggestion to test the solution just prior to implementation is too late, since the solution has already been constructed and any surprises will likely impact schedule and budget. The attention to artifacts is superfluous.  |
