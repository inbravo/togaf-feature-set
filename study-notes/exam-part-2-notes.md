## Part 2 - Exam Helpful Notes

### Risk Assessment

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 |  You recommend that techniques be used throughout the program to manage risk including risk monitoring. This will enable you to identify, classify, and mitigate the risks associated with the proposed transformation and ensure suitable business continuity plans are in place. In the Implementation Governance phase, you ensure a residual risk assessment is conducted to determine the best way to manage risks that cannot be mitigated. | This is the best answer. ***It summarizes the approach recommended in the TOGAF chapter on Risk Management***. It recognizes that ***risk has to be managed through all ADM phases***, and that ***you need to identify, classify, and mitigate risk before starting a transformation***. In the ***Implementation Governance phase, those residual risks should be understood and managed to the extent possible***. |
| 2 | You recommend that a risk management framework is used in Phase G, the Implementation Governance phase. This would include a risk classification scheme and completion of worksheets for risk assessment. This will enable you to assess the risks associated with the proposed business transformation. You then ensure that the initial level of risk is well understood before issuing the Architecture Contracts. | This choice is ***less correct since it performs No Risk Assessment prior to the Implementation Governance phase***. *** However it provides good guidance on managing the risks using worksheets***. Additionally, ***this answer does not address risk monitoring or the management of residual risks*** |
| 3 | You recommend classifying the risks in terms of time, cost, and scope during the Architecture Vision phase. This will enable you to ensure that certain risks with certain types of impact are managed by the right individuals. You would then ensure that the Architecture Contracts issued in the Implementation Governance phase address those initial risks and include adequate risk monitoring actions to confirm they have been addressed | The ***TOGAF standard does recommend conducting risk classification in Phase A***; however, the ***classifications being proposed do not address the concerns being put forward***. Also this ***Answer does not address the mitigation of risks or residual risk assessment*** |

### Stakeholder Analysis

| ## |   **Option**   |  **Recommendation**    |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 1 |  You would identify key stakeholders across both the current airline and the new acquisition. You would classify their positions and influence, recording the results in a stakeholder map. You would then focus on key stakeholders ensuring that you identify the most relevant architecture viewpoints for each stakeholder and validate that their concerns are being addressed. You would communicate with stakeholders early and frequently, ensuring that they fully understand the architecture process.  | This is the best answer. ***Stakeholder analysis*** and the development of a ***Stakeholder Map*** is the technique that the TOGAF standard recommends for ***identifying and engaging the key stakeholders in Phase A***. ***The Stakeholder Map is a major product output*** and used to support other outputs in this phase. |
| 2 |  You would conduct a series of business scenarios with the stakeholders impacted by the acquisition, and determine which stakeholders are likely to block the initiative and which are likely to support it. This would let you identify and understand business needs, and derive the business requirements that the architecture development has to address. You would identify the most relevant architecture viewpoints and validate with the stakeholders. |  This answer is ***less correct since it omits the Stakeholder Map approach*** recommended by the TOGAF standard to explicitly identify stakeholders. ***Business scenarios are an appropriate technique to develop the Architecture Vision*** and can accomplish some of the engagement. This ***answer also lacks the identification of key players*** and the active engagement policy of stakeholder analysis. |
| 3 |  You would focus on communications with the stakeholders at the regional carrier as effective communication of targeted information to the right stakeholders at the right time is a critical success factor for such a merger. You would develop a Communications Plan, which would allow you to plan and manage the process. It would ensure that stakeholders are aware of the key features of the architecture and have the opportunity to comment. | This answer is ***less correct since it focuses on stakeholders at the regional carrier only***, thus ***omitting key stakeholders that should be involved***. The Communications Plan is produced from the work done by the Stakeholder Management approach suggested in answer A. |
