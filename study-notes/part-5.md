## Part 5 - Enterprise Continuum
- The Enterprise Continuum is a view of the repository of all the architecture assets. 
- It can contain architecture descriptions, models, building blocks, patterns, viewpoints, and other artifacts 
- It contains the architectures that exist both within the enterprise and in the IT industry at large
- The Enterprise Continuum enables the organization of re-usable architecture artifacts and solution assets to maximize the enterprise architecture investment opportunities

#### Architecture Continuum
- The Architecture Continuum illustrates how architectures are developed and evolved across a continuum ranging from Foundation Architectures
- The leftwards direction focuses on meeting enterprise needs and business requirements 
- The rightwards direction focuses on leveraging architectural components and building blocks

#### Solutions Continuum
- The Solutions Continuum is a population of the architecture with reference building blocks
- The Solutions Continuum represents the detailed specification and construction of the architectures at the corresponding levels of the Architecture Continuum

#### Architecture Repository
- Operating a mature Architecture Capability within a large enterprise creates a huge volume of architectural output 
- Effective management and leverage of these architectural work products require a formal taxonomy
- At a high level, the following classes of architectural information are expected to be held within an Architecture Repository
   -  ***Architecture Metamodel*** describes the organizationally tailored application of an architecture framework
   -  ***Architecture Capability*** defines the parameters, structures, and processes
   -  ***Architecture Landscape*** presents an architectural representation of assets
   -  ***Standards Information*** Base captures the standards with which new architectures must comply
   -  ***Reference Library*** provides guidelines, templates, patterns, and other forms of reference material
   -  ***Governance Log*** provides a record of governance activity across the enterprise
   -  ***Architecture Requirements Repository*** provides a view of all authorized architecture requirements
   -  ***Solutions Landscape*** presents an architectural representation of the Solution Building Blocks (SBBs)
