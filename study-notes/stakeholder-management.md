## Part 3 - ADM Guidelines and Techniquies

### Stakeholder Management
- Stakeholder management is an important discipline that successful architecture practitioners can use to win support from others.
- It helps them ensure that their projects succeed where others fail.
- Following concepts are used during the Stakeholder Management
	- Architecture View
	- Architecture Viewpoint
	- Concern
	- Stakeholder

#### Approach to Stakeholder Management  (ICDT)
- ***Identify*** Stakeholders
- ***Classify*** their Positions
- ***Determine*** the Stakeholder Management Approach
- ***Tailor*** Engagement Deliverables 

#### Identify Stakeholders
-  The below mentioned sample distinguishes 22 types of stakeholder, in five broad categories

#### Classify Stakeholder Positions
- It is important to assess the readiness of each stakeholder to behave in a supportive manner
- This can be done by asking a series of questions:
	- Is that person ready to change direction and begin moving towards the Target Architecture? If so, how ready?
	- Is that person capable of being a credible advocate or agent of the proposed Enterprise Architecture initiative? If so, how capable?
	- How involved is the individual in the Enterprise Architecture initiative? Are they simply an interested observer, or do they need to be involved in the details?
	- Has that person made a contractual commitment to the development of the Enterprise Architecture, and its role in the governance of the development of the organization?

#### Determine Stakeholder Management Approach
- A sample Power/Interest Matrix Example

#### Tailor Engagement Deliverables
- Identify catalogs, matrices, and diagrams that the architecture engagement needs to produce and validate with each stakeholder group to deliver an effective architecture model.
- It is important to pay particular attention to stakeholder interests by defining specific catalogs, matrices, and diagrams that are relevant for a particular Enterprise Architecture model. This enables the architecture to be communicated to, and understood by, all the stakeholders, and enables them to verify that the Enterprise Architecture initiative will address their concerns.
