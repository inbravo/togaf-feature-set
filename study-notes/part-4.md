## Part 4 - TOGAF Architecture Content Framework (ACF)
- Architects executing the ADM will produce architectural content as a result of their efforts
- ACF provides a ***Structural Model for Architectural Content*** that allows major work products to be ***consistently Defined, Structured, and Presented***
- Core content metamodel is how to structure your content within the repository, including the extentions

  - ***Deliverables (D)***
  - ***Artifacts (A)***
  - ***Building Blocks (B)***
