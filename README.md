## Part 1 - Introduction

#### **The Open Group** 

   |      |      |  
   | ----------- | ----------- | 
   | Vision  | ***Boundaryless Information Flow*** Boundaries exists but permeable to enable business | 
   | Mission | Creation of ***Boundaryless Information Flow*** achieved by working with customers and suppliers |
   | Architecture Forum Mission | Advance the Open Group vision of ***Boundaryless Information Flow*** for and between enterprises |

#### Enterprise Architecture (EA)
A discipline - 
- That defines, organises, standardizes, and documents the whole architecture and all important elements of the respective organisation, covering relevant domains such as business, digital, physical, or organisational; and 
- The relations and interactions between elements that belong to those domains, such as processes, functions, applications, events, data, or technologies

   |      |      |  
   | ----------- | ----------- | 
   | Need | Preparation for business transformation or any radical infrastructure change initiates |
   | Purpose  | To optimize across the enterprise the often fragmented legacy of processes into an integrated environment that is responsive to change and supportive of the delivery of the business strategy | 
   | Benefits | More effective and efficient **_Business operations_**, Digital Transformation and **_IT operations_**, Better return on  **_Existing Investment_**, Reduced Risk for  **_Future Investment_**, Faster, simpler, and cheaper **_Procurement_** |

#### Architecture Framework
- A foundational structure, or set of structures, which can be used for developing different architectures 
- Should describe a method for designing a target state of the enterprise in terms of a set of building blocks
- Should contain a set of tools and provide a common vocabulary 
- Should also include a list of recommended standards and compliant products that can be used to implement the building blocks
- Value of Architecture Framework
   - Systematic ***Codified Common Sense***
   - Avoids the initial panic when the scale of the task becomes apparent and provides a starting point for an architecture project
 
 #### Architecture
 - ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 definition: 
   - _**The fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships, and in the principles of its design and evolution**._
- TOGAF definition: 
   - _**The structure of components, their inter-relationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time**._

#### TOGAF Standard
- A Customer Initiative based on the ***Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management*** (TAFIM from US DoD)
- A ***Framework*** not ***Architecture*** to develop architectures to meet different business needs
- TOGAF as Enterprise Architecture (EA) framework
  - TOGAF provides the ***methods and tools*** for assisting in the ***Acceptance***, ***Production***, ***Use***, and ***Maintenance*** (***APUM***) of an EA. 
  - It is based on an ***Iterative Process Model*** supported by best practices and a re-usable set of existing architecture assets.
- TOGAF uses ***Architecture Development Method (ADM)*** to develop an ***Enterprise Architecture (EA)***
- TOGAF Standard helps in creating following Architecture types (BDAT) using ADM
   - ***Business Architecture (B)***: defines the business strategy, governance, organization, and key business processes
   - ***Data Architecture (D)***: describes the structure of an organization's logical and physical data assets and data management resources
   - ***Application Architecture (A)***: provides a blueprint for the applications to be deployed, their interactions, and their relationships to the core business processes
   - ***Technical Architecture (T)***: describes the logical software & hardware capabilities, required to support the deployment of business, data, and application services

#### TOGAF Parts
1. ***Introduction*** is a step by step approach, which is at the core of the TOGAF framework
2. ***Architecture Development Method (ADM)*** is a step by step approach, which is at the core of the TOGAF framework
3. ***ADM Guidelines & Techniques*** contains a collection of guidelines and techniques used while applying the TOGAF ADM
4. ***Architecture Content Framework*** describes a structured metamodel for architectural artifacts, using re-usable Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs)
5. ***Enterprise Continuum & Tools*** discusses appropriate taxonomies and tools to categorize and store the outputs of architecture activity
6. ***Architecture Capability Framework*** discusses the organization, processes, skills, roles, and responsibilities required to establish and operate an architecture function within an enterprise
